# ESP32-Based-Collision-Detection
This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to detect vehicle collisions through a collision sensor and immediately sends an email alert with live location to the owner using Wi-Fi and Gmail SMTP. The vehicle can also be manually controlled via Bluetooth, and visual/audio alerts are provided using LEDs and a buzzer.
